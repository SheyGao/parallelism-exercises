## Setting up

Clone this repo, edit it locally, and push and submit to Gradescope, exactly as in P1. You should submit it multiple times, in each of the Gradescope assignments. You should use Java 11 when
working on this.

You should only edit:

1. HasOver.java
1. GetLongestSequence.java and SequenceRange.java
1. GetLeftMostIndex.java
1. FilterEmpty.java

and do not change the method signature. Feel free to add private
methods as you see fit. Please read the comments in each file for instructions.

## Grading

We will be running an autograder to grade your submission. All the tests are public, so your final grade on Gradescope will be
what goes into the gradebook. The points will be weighted more heavily on your code running properly in parallel and the stress tests.
